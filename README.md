## Function
This program selects the optimal ribosome binding site from a list of genetic parts for a gene to minimize hairpins, ensuring efficent translation. 
This program is designed to be compatable with Professor Christopher Anderson's SYNISTER database and can be found under composition/RBSchooser2.
RBS parts are listed under composition/data/rbs_options in TSV format: name, description, RBS, CDS
